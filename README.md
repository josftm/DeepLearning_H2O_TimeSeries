# Deep-Feed-Forward for multi-step time series forecasting

This is the code associated to the article "*A novel scalable approach based on deep learning for big data time series forecasting*", sent to the **Integrated Computer-Aided Engineering** journal.

The code is written for the R language. To run it, you must be installed correctly the *h2o, rsparkling, sparklyr and dplyr* packages (you should be carefull with the version of these packages and your R version). Moreover, you must have a cluster of machines with the *Spark and H2O framework* working successfully to run the algorithm in distributed mode.
